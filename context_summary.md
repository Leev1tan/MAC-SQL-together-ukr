# MAC-SQL with Together AI Project Summary

## Our Current Understanding

MAC-SQL represents a significant advancement in text-to-SQL generation through its innovative multi-agent collaboration framework. After thoroughly analyzing the codebase and architecture, we now understand that MAC-SQL consists of three specialized intelligent agents working together to tackle different aspects of the text-to-SQL challenge:

1. **Selector Agent**: Analyzes and prunes database schemas to focus only on relevant tables and columns. This agent addresses the challenge of handling large database schemas that would otherwise exceed context windows in large language models. According to the MAC-SQL paper, this agent can significantly reduce input length by filtering out irrelevant parts of the schema while ensuring critical schema information is preserved.

2. **Decomposer Agent**: Breaks down complex queries into manageable sub-queries using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Rather than attempting to solve intricate queries in a single pass, this agent follows a human-like reasoning process to solve problems incrementally. The decomposer is particularly effective for complex nested queries that require multiple logical steps.

3. **Refiner Agent**: Validates generated SQL by executing it against the actual database, analyzing error messages, and correcting mistakes. This agent provides quality assurance by detecting syntax errors, logical flaws, and execution failures, then making appropriate adjustments to ensure the query functions correctly.

These agents are orchestrated by a `ChatManager` class that facilitates communication between them through a message-passing system. Each agent processes the message, performs its specialized task, and then passes the enhanced message to the next agent until the final SQL query is generated.

## Our Current Implementation 

Our current implementation in `run_with_together.py` has successfully integrated Together AI with the MAC-SQL framework, but does not yet fully utilize the three-agent architecture. Instead, we've implemented a more direct pipeline approach that:

1. **Loads and formats database schemas**: We've enhanced schema handling with special adaptations for the BIRD dataset format, enabling proper interpretation of table structures.

2. **Generates SQL queries through direct API calls**: We prompt Together AI's models with formatted schema information and natural language queries to generate SQL.

3. **Evaluates results using execution-based metrics**: We've implemented an innovative execution-based evaluation that compares the results of executing the generated SQL against executing the gold standard SQL.

This implementation has proven effective, particularly for the BIRD dataset, and has laid the groundwork for further improvements. However, it doesn't yet leverage the full potential of MAC-SQL's agent architecture.

## The Problem

While our current implementation works, it misses several key benefits of the agent-based approach:

1. **Schema Pruning**: Without the Selector agent's ability to prune database schemas, we're including more information than necessary in our prompts, potentially diluting the model's focus on relevant tables and columns.

2. **Complex Query Handling**: Without the Decomposer agent's step-by-step reasoning approach, our system may struggle with highly complex queries that require multi-step logical reasoning.

3. **Refined Error Handling**: While we do basic error handling, the specialized Refiner agent from MAC-SQL would provide more sophisticated error detection and correction.

4. **Agent-to-Agent Learning**: The current pipeline lacks the interactive learning opportunities that emerge when specialized agents collaborate and build upon each other's work.

These limitations potentially impact our system's performance, particularly on complex queries and large database schemas.

## Our Aim

Our aim is to fully integrate Together AI with MAC-SQL's three-agent architecture to maximize query generation accuracy and robustness. Specifically, we want to:

1. **Maintain our current improvements**: Preserve our enhanced schema handling for BIRD and execution-based evaluation metrics.

2. **Incorporate the agent framework**: Integrate the Selector, Decomposer, and Refiner agents to handle complex queries more effectively.

3. **Ensure flexibility across datasets**: Extend support to both BIRD and SPIDER datasets with dataset-specific optimizations.

4. **Enable comparative evaluation**: Build a system that allows us to benchmark the agent-based approach against our current pipeline approach.

5. **Optimize Together AI integration**: Fine-tune the integration to get the most out of Together AI's models within the agent framework.

By achieving these aims, we expect to improve performance metrics (Execution Accuracy and Exact Match) on both datasets, particularly for complex queries.

## Detailed Transition Strategy

Transitioning from our current pipeline to a full agent-based architecture requires careful planning and incremental implementation. Here's our detailed strategy:

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Preparation (2-3 days)

1. **Adapter Module Creation**:
   - Create a `macsql_together_adapter.py` file that will serve as the bridge between Together AI's API and MAC-SQL's agent architecture
   - Implement a `TogetherAIAdapter` class that configures the MAC-SQL environment to use Together AI instead of OpenAI
   - Modify the `api_func` in `llm.py` to use Together AI's API endpoints

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Set up proper environment variable handling to switch between pipeline and agent-based approaches
   - Create configuration options for model selection, temperature settings, and other API parameters
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing test scripts

3. **Logging Infrastructure**:
   - Implement detailed logging across agents to track the conversation flow
   - Create visualization tools for agent interactions to aid debugging
   - Set up performance metrics tracking to compare approaches

### Phase 2: Custom Agent Implementation (3-4 days)

1. **Enhanced Selector Agent**:
   ```python
   class EnhancedSelector(Selector):
       """Extended Selector that handles BIRD schema format"""
       
       def _load_db_info(self, db_id: str):
           # First try our enhanced schema loading
           schema = load_bird_tables(self.data_path, db_id)
           if schema:
               formatted_schema = format_schema_for_api(schema, db_id)
               self.db2infos[db_id] = formatted_schema
               return formatted_schema
           
           # Fall back to original method if our method fails
           return super()._load_db_info(db_id)
   ```
   
   This agent will incorporate our enhanced schema handling while maintaining the pruning capabilities of the original Selector.

2. **Enhanced Decomposer Agent**:
   ```python
   class EnhancedDecomposer(Decomposer):
       """Extended Decomposer with dataset-specific optimizations"""
       
       def talk(self, message):
           # Check dataset type and apply specific optimizations
           if message.get('dataset_type') == 'bird':
               # Apply BIRD-specific prompt enhancements
               self._apply_bird_optimizations(message)
           elif message.get('dataset_type') == 'spider':
               # Apply SPIDER-specific optimizations
               self._apply_spider_optimizations(message)
               
           # Call original decomposer
           super().talk(message)
   ```
   
   This agent will maintain the core decomposition logic while adding dataset-specific optimizations.

3. **Enhanced Refiner Agent**:
   ```python
   class EnhancedRefiner(Refiner):
       """Extended Refiner with execution-based evaluation"""
       
       def talk(self, message):
           # First use the original refiner
           super().talk(message)
           
           # Then add execution-based evaluation
           if 'pred' in message and 'ground_truth' in message:
               # Fix column names
               fixed_pred_sql = fix_column_names(message['pred'])
               
               # Evaluate execution
               execution_match, results = evaluate_sql_query(
                   pred_sql=fixed_pred_sql,
                   gold_sql=message['ground_truth'],
                   db_id=message['db_id'],
                   data_path=self.data_path
               )
               
               # Store results
               message['pred'] = fixed_pred_sql
               message['execution_match'] = execution_match
               message['execution_results'] = results
   ```
   
   This agent will incorporate our execution-based evaluation while maintaining the error correction capabilities of the original Refiner.

### Phase 3: Integration with Chat Manager (2-3 days)

1. **Custom Chat Manager**:
   ```python
   class EnhancedChatManager(ChatManager):
       """Custom chat manager with enhanced agents"""
       
       def __init__(self, data_path, tables_json_path, log_path, model_name, dataset_name):
           # Skip parent init and create our own setup
           self.data_path = data_path
           self.tables_json_path = tables_json_path
           self.log_path = log_path
           self.model_name = model_name
           self.dataset_name = dataset_name
           
           # Create chat group with enhanced agents
           self.chat_group = [
               EnhancedSelector(data_path=self.data_path, 
                                tables_json_path=self.tables_json_path,
                                model_name=self.model_name, 
                                dataset_name=self.dataset_name),
               EnhancedDecomposer(dataset_name=self.dataset_name),
               EnhancedRefiner(data_path=self.data_path, 
                               dataset_name=self.dataset_name)
           ]
           
           # Initialize logging
           from core import llm
           llm.init_log_path(log_path)
   ```
   
   This custom manager will orchestrate our enhanced agents while maintaining compatibility with MAC-SQL's message-passing architecture.

2. **Integration Function**:
   ```python
   def run_with_agents(dataset_path, db_path, num_samples=5, dataset_type='bird'):
       """
       Run evaluation using agent-based architecture
       
       Args:
           dataset_path: Path to dataset file
           db_path: Path to database directory
           num_samples: Number of samples to evaluate
           dataset_type: 'bird' or 'spider'
       
       Returns:
           Evaluation results
       """
       # Set up adapter for Together AI
       TogetherAIAdapter.set_api_integration()
       
       # Get tables.json path based on dataset type
       tables_json_path = _get_tables_json_path(dataset_path, dataset_type)
       
       # Initialize manager
       manager = EnhancedChatManager(
           data_path=db_path,
           tables_json_path=tables_json_path,
           log_path=f"logs/{dataset_type}_agent_test.log",
           model_name=TOGETHER_MODEL,
           dataset_name=dataset_type
       )
       
       # Load queries based on dataset type
       if dataset_type == 'bird':
           queries = load_bird_subset(dataset_path, num_samples=num_samples)
       else:
           queries = load_spider_subset(dataset_path, num_samples=num_samples)
       
       # Process queries through agent framework
       results = []
       for query in queries:
           # Create message for chat manager
           message = _create_message_for_query(query, dataset_type)
           
           # Process through agents
           manager.start(message)
           
           # Store results
           results.append(_extract_results_from_message(message, query))
       
       return results
   ```
   
   This function will provide a unified interface for running evaluations using our agent-based architecture.

### Phase 4: Testing and Comparison Framework (2-3 days)

1. **Comparative Testing Script**:
   ```python
   def run_comparative_test(dataset_type, num_samples=10):
       """
       Run both pipeline and agent-based approaches on the same queries
       
       Args:
           dataset_type: 'bird' or 'spider'
           num_samples: Number of samples to test
       
       Returns:
           Comparative results
       """
       # Find dataset
       dataset_path, db_path = _find_dataset_path(dataset_type)
       
       # Run pipeline approach
       pipeline_results = run_pipeline_test(
           dataset_path=dataset_path,
           db_path=db_path,
           num_samples=num_samples,
           dataset_type=dataset_type
       )
       
       # Run agent-based approach
       agent_results = run_with_agents(
           dataset_path=dataset_path,
           db_path=db_path,
           num_samples=num_samples,
           dataset_type=dataset_type
       )
       
       # Compare results
       comparison = _compare_results(pipeline_results, agent_results)
       
       # Save detailed comparison
       _save_comparison(comparison, f"output/{dataset_type}_comparison.json")
       
       return comparison
   ```
   
   This function will allow us to directly compare the performance of both approaches on the same queries.

2. **Detailed Analysis Tools**:
   - Implement error categorization to understand where each approach fails
   - Create visualization tools to highlight differences in generated SQL
   - Develop metrics to quantify the impact of each agent on overall performance

### Phase 5: Optimization and Benchmarking (3-4 days)

1. **Parameter Optimization**:
   - Experiment with different temperature settings for each agent
   - Test different prompt formulations for agent instructions
   - Optimize the message structure passed between agents

2. **Performance Benchmarking**:
   - Run full evaluations on both BIRD and SPIDER datasets
   - Compare against state-of-the-art results from the MAC-SQL paper
   - Analyze performance differences across query complexity levels

3. **Documentation and Reporting**:
   - Document the agent-based architecture and its benefits
   - Create detailed usage guides for both approaches
   - Prepare visualization and analysis of benchmarking results

## Expected Outcomes

By implementing this transition strategy, we expect to achieve:

1. **Performance Improvements**: Based on the MAC-SQL paper, we should see significant improvements in execution accuracy, particularly for complex queries. The paper reports improvements of:
   - +4.63% on BIRD development set
   - +2.18% on BIRD test set
   - Comparable improvements on SPIDER

2. **Better Understanding**: The agent architecture will provide greater visibility into the text-to-SQL generation process, helping us identify and address specific failure points.

3. **Advanced Error Handling**: The Refiner agent should provide more sophisticated error correction, reducing syntax errors and schema linking issues.

4. **Broader Dataset Support**: Our enhanced architecture should handle both BIRD and SPIDER datasets effectively, with dataset-specific optimizations.

5. **Flexible Deployment Options**: Users will be able to choose between the simpler pipeline approach and the more sophisticated agent-based approach depending on their needs.

## Conclusion

The transition from our current pipeline approach to a full agent-based architecture represents a significant advancement in our text-to-SQL capability. By leveraging the specialized capabilities of the Selector, Decomposer, and Refiner agents while maintaining our enhancements for schema handling and execution-based evaluation, we expect to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both BIRD and SPIDER datasets.

This approach will not only improve performance metrics but also provide greater visibility into the text-to-SQL generation process, enabling further targeted improvements. The flexible architecture will allow us to mix and match components, experiment with different configurations, and identify the optimal setup for different types of queries and databases.

By following our detailed transition strategy, we can implement this enhancement incrementally, ensuring that we maintain compatibility with existing code while progressively unlocking the full potential of the agent-based architecture.

## Recent Issues and Solutions

### API Configuration Issues

We discovered that the codebase was attempting to use OpenAI's API client to access Llama models, which was resulting in errors like:

```
Error communicating with OpenAI: Invalid URL 'your_own_api_base/openai/deployments/gpt-4-1106-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2023-07-01-preview': No scheme supplied.
```

The problem was that the system was configured to use placeholder API URLs instead of properly integrating with Together AI. The project should be using Together AI's API for accessing Meta Llama models, not OpenAI.

### Compatibility Issues

We identified and fixed several compatibility issues in the agent implementations:

1. **Decomposer Compatibility**: The original `Decomposer` class only accepted a `dataset_name` parameter, but our enhanced implementation required both `model_name` and `dataset_name`. We updated the constructor to accept both parameters for compatibility.

2. **Refiner Compatibility**: The `EnhancedSpiderRefiner` was passing a `model_name` parameter to the base `Refiner` class, which didn't accept it. We modified the `Refiner.__init__` method to accept and ignore this parameter.

3. **Missing Method**: The `EnhancedSpiderSelector` class was missing the crucial `call_llm` method needed to interact with language models. We implemented this method to ensure compatibility with the rest of the framework.

### Performance Issues

We improved startup performance by modifying the default behavior of the `Selector` class:

1. **Lazy Loading**: Changed the `Selector` class to use lazy loading by default (changed `lazy=False` to `lazy=True`). This prevents the expensive `_load_all_db_info` method from extracting all database schema details upfront, significantly reducing startup time.

### Error Handling Improvements

We enhanced error handling to make the code more robust:

1. **Key Error in `extract_world_info`**: The function was raising `KeyError: 'idx'` because some messages didn't contain this key. We updated the function to use the `.get()` method with default values to prevent this error.

### Next Steps

1. **Together AI Integration**: 
   - Ensure proper initialization of the Together AI adapter before any API calls
   - Verify that environment variables like `TOGETHER_API_KEY` and `TOGETHER_MODEL` are correctly set

2. **Testing**:
   - Run tests with a small number of samples to verify all our fixes work together
   - Monitor for any new issues that might arise

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update documentation to clearly explain the Together AI requirements
   - Document the compatibility adjustments we've made between original and enhanced implementations

2. **Message Tracking System**:
   - Fixed issues with message tracking to ensure all agent interactions are properly captured
   - Implemented robust error handling for the tracking system
   - Added support for reconstructing agent flow when messages are missing
   - Captured schema and reasoning data separately to ensure they're included in visualization

3. **Visualization Features**:
   - Added interactive elements like collapsible sections for schema and reasoning
   - Implemented visual hierarchy to highlight important information
   - Added visual differentiation between different agent types

   - Compatibility testing with various browsers and screen sizes

2. **Additional Features**:
   - Add search functionality within visualizations
   - Implement filtering options (by agent, message type, etc.)
   - Add export options for different formats
   - Provide direct comparison views for gold vs. predicted SQL

3. **Documentation**:
   - Create user documentation for the visualization system
   - Document the API for extending or customizing visualizations
   - Add examples of different visualization outputs

4. **Integration Improvements**:
   - Better integration with the test runner interface
   - Automatic visualization generation during test runs
   - Live updating visualization during agent interactions

By implementing these visualization improvements, we've significantly enhanced the ability to debug and understand the multi-agent text-to-SQL system. The improved visualizations make it easier to identify where the system is making mistakes and provide better insights into the reasoning process of each agent.
