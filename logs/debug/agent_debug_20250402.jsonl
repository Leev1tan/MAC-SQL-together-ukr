This relationship allows us to connect a match with its respective league.\n\nTherefore, the relevant tables and columns for answering the question are:\n\n- **Match** table:\n  - `date`\n  - `home_team_goal`\n  - `away_team_goal`\n  - `league_id`\n\n- **League** table:\n  - `id`\n  - `name`\n\nTo find the final score for the match on September 24, 2008, in the Belgian Jupiler League, we need to join the `Match` and `League` tables on the `league_id` and filter the results based on the date and league name.\n\n**PRUNED DATABASE SCHEMA:**\n\n```sql\n# Table: Match\n[\n  (id, id),\n  (date, date),\n  (home_team_goal, home team goal),\n  (away_team_goal, away team goal),\n  (league_id, league id)\n]\n\n# Table: League\n[\n  (id, id),\n  (name, name)\n]\n```\n\n**Example Query:**\n\n```sql\nSELECT M.home_team_goal, M.away_team_goal\nFROM Match M\nJOIN League L ON M.league_id = L.id\nWHERE M.date LIKE '2008-09-24%' AND L.name = 'Belgium Jupiler League';\n```"}, "chosen_db_schem_dict": {"Player_Attributes": ["id", "player_fifa_api_id", "player_api_id", "date", "overall_rating", "potential", "preferred_foot", "attacking_work_rate", "defensive_work_rate", "crossing", "finishing", "heading_accuracy", "short_passing", "volleys", "dribbling", "curve", "free_kick_accuracy", "long_passing", "ball_control", "acceleration", "sprint_speed", "agility", "reactions", "balance", "shot_power", "jumping", "stamina", "strength", "long_shots", "aggression", "interceptions", "positioning", "vision", "penalties", "marking", "standing_tackle", "sliding_tackle", "gk_diving", "gk_handling", "gk_kicking", "gk_positioning", "gk_reflexes"], "Player": ["id", "player_api_id", "player_name", "player_fifa_api_id", "birthday", "height", "weight"], "League": ["id", "country_id", "name"], "Country": ["id", "name"], "Team": ["id", "team_api_id", "team_fifa_api_id", "team_long_name", "team_short_name"], "Team_Attributes": ["id", "team_fifa_api_id", "team_api_id", "date", "buildUpPlaySpeed", "buildUpPlaySpeedClass", "buildUpPlayDribbling", "buildUpPlayDribblingClass", "buildUpPlayPassing", "buildUpPlayPassingClass", "buildUpPlayPositioningClass", "chanceCreationPassing", "chanceCreationPassingClass", "chanceCreationCrossing", "chanceCreationCrossingClass", "chanceCreationShooting", "chanceCreationShootingClass", "chanceCreationPositioningClass", "defencePressure", "defencePressureClass", "defenceAggression", "defenceAggressionClass", "defenceTeamWidth", "defenceTeamWidthClass", "defenceDefenderLineClass"], "Match": ["id", "country_id", "league_id", "season", "stage", "date", "match_api_id", "home_team_api_id", "away_team_api_id", "home_team_goal", "away_team_goal", "home_player_X1", "home_player_X2", "home_player_X3", "home_player_X4", "home_player_X5", "home_player_X6", "home_player_X7", "home_player_X8", "home_player_X9", "home_player_X10", "home_player_X11", "away_player_X1", "away_player_X2", "away_player_X3", "away_player_X4", "away_player_X5", "away_player_X6", "away_player_X7", "away_player_X8", "away_player_X9", "away_player_X10", "away_player_X11", "home_player_Y1", "home_player_Y2", "home_player_Y3", "home_player_Y4", "home_player_Y5", "home_player_Y6", "home_player_Y7", "home_player_Y8", "home_player_Y9", "home_player_Y10", "home_player_Y11", "away_player_Y1", "away_player_Y2", "away_player_Y3", "away_player_Y4", "away_player_Y5", "away_player_Y6", "away_player_Y7", "away_player_Y8", "away_player_Y9", "away_player_Y10", "away_player_Y11", "home_player_1", "home_player_2", "home_player_3", "home_player_4", "home_player_5", "home_player_6", "home_player_7", "home_player_8", "home_player_9", "home_player_10", "home_player_11", "away_player_1", "away_player_2", "away_player_3", "away_player_4", "away_player_5", "away_player_6", "away_player_7", "away_player_8", "away_player_9", "away_player_10", "away_player_11", "goal", "shoton", "shotoff", "foulcommit", "card", "cross", "corner", "possession", "B365H", "B365D", "B365A", "BWH", "BWD", "BWA", "IWH", "IWD", "IWA", "LBH", "LBD", "LBA", "PSH", "PSD", "PSA", "WHH", "WHD", "WHA", "SJH", "SJD", "SJA", "VCH", "VCD", "VCA", "GBH", "GBD", "GBA", "BSH", "BSD", "BSA"]}, "desc_str": "# Table: Player_Attributes\n[\n  (id, id.),\n  (player_fifa_api_id, player federation international football association api id.),\n  (player_api_id, player api id.),\n  (date, date.

This involves joining the `cards` table with the `sets` table (through the `setCode` in `cards` and the `code` in `sets`), and then checking the `set_translations` table for a Korean translation.\n\nHowever, the provided schema does not directly link `cards` to `sets` through a foreign key, but it does link `cards` to `sets` indirectly through the `setCode` in `cards` and the `code` in `sets`. Also, the `set_translations` table links to `sets` through the `setCode`.\n\nGiven the schema, the correct approach involves finding the set code for \"Ancestor's Chosen\" and then checking for a Korean translation in the `set_translations` table.\n\n```sql\nSELECT T3.`translation`\nFROM `cards` AS T1\nINNER JOIN `sets` AS T2\nON T1.`setCode` = T2.`code`\nINNER JOIN `set_translations` AS T3\nON T2.`code` = T3.`setCode`\nWHERE T1.`name` = 'Ancestor''s Chosen'\nAND T3.`language` = 'Korean';\n```\n\nThis query will return the translation of the set containing \"Ancestor's Chosen\" in Korean, if it exists. If no rows are returned, it means there is no Korean version of the set.\n\n### Combining the Queries\nSince the second query already incorporates the logic to find the set containing \"Ancestor's Chosen\" and checks for a Korean translation, the first query is primarily for understanding the process step by step.

However, it does not directly contain attribute values like intelligence.\n- The **attribute** table lists different attributes that a superhero can have, such as 'Strength', 'Speed', 'Intelligence', etc. This table is crucial because it contains the attribute name 'Intelligence' that we are interested in.\n- The **hero_attribute** table connects superheroes with their attributes and the corresponding attribute values. This table is essential because it contains the attribute values for each superhero, including the one for 'Intelligence'.\n\nGiven the evidence that the dumbest superhero refers to the one with the MIN(attribute_value) where attribute_name = 'Intelligence', we focus on the following tables and columns:\n\n1. **hero_attribute** table:\n   - **hero_id**: To identify the superhero.\n   - **attribute_id**: To identify the attribute (in this case, 'Intelligence').\n   - **attribute_value**: To find the minimum value, which corresponds to the \"dumbest\" superhero.\n\n2. **attribute** table:\n   - **id**: To match with **attribute_id** in the **hero_attribute** table and ensure we are looking at 'Intelligence'.\n   - **attribute_name**: To filter for 'Intelligence'.\n\n3. **superhero** table:\n   - **id**: To match with **hero_id** in the **hero_attribute** table, allowing us to identify the superhero by name.\n   - **superhero_name**: To know the name of the superhero who is the \"dumbest\".\n\nThe join conditions needed are:\n- **hero_attribute.hero_id** = **superhero.id**\n- **hero_attribute.attribute_id** = **attribute.id**\n\nAnd the condition to filter for 'Intelligence' is:\n- **attribute.attribute_name** = 'Intelligence'\n\nThus, the relevant tables and columns for answering the question are:\n\n# Table: superhero\n[\n  (id, id.),\n  (superhero_name, superhero name.)\n]\n# Table: attribute\n[\n  (id, id.),\n  (attribute_name, attribute name.)\n]\n# Table: hero_attribute\n[\n  (hero_id, hero id.),\n  (attribute_id, attribute id.),\n  (attribute_value, attribute value.)\n]\n\nThese tables and columns will allow us to find the superhero with the minimum 'Intelligence' attribute value, thereby identifying the \"dumbest\" superhero."}, "chosen_db_schem_dict": {"alignment": ["id", "alignment"], "attribute": ["id", "attribute_name"], "colour": ["id", "colour"], "gender": ["id", "gender"], "publisher": ["id", "publisher_name"], "race": ["id", "race"], "superhero": ["id", "superhero_name", "full_name", "gender_id", "eye_colour_id", "hair_colour_id", "skin_colour_id", "race_id", "publisher_id", "alignment_id", "height_cm", "weight_kg"], "hero_attribute": ["hero_id", "attribute_id", "attribute_value"], "superpower": ["id", "power_name"], "hero_power": ["hero_id", "power_id"]}, "desc_str": "# Table: alignment\n[\n  (id, id.),\n  (alignment, alignment.
